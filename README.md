Monoalphabetic Substitution Tool :computer:
==========================
A tool to encrypt or decrypt messages, inspired on [this web tool: The Black chamber](https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/substitutioncrackingtool.html).

> A monoalphabetic substitution cipher, also known as a simple substitution cipher, relies on a fixed replacement structure. That is, the substitution is fixed for each letter of the alphabet. Thus, if "a" is encrypted to "R", then every time we see the letter "a" in the plaintext, we replace it with the letter "R" in the ciphertext. <sup>[1]</sup>

## Instruction :page_with_curl:
If you want to **decrypt** a message encrypted with the substitution tool:

1. Paste the enciphered message or the message you want to decrypt in the top textbox.
2. Select the option  `DESENCRIPTAR`
3. Enter the letters that probably match in the empty boxes on `Ciphertext Alphabet` with the row `Plaintext Alphabet`.
4. All these letters will be transformed into the letters inserted and you have made the first step towards cracking the message.
5. You will soon be able to spot words and guess other letters by their context.
6. **Good Luck!**

If you want to **encrypt** a message with the substitution tool:

1. Paste the message you want to encrypt in the top textbox.
2. Select the option `ENCRIPTAR`
3. Enter some letters in the empty boxes above `Plaintext Alphabet` in the row `Ciphertext Alphabet`.
